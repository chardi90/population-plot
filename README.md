## Installation  
Clone the repository and install the required packages:  

Fork üîÅ the [Repl](https://replit.com/@chardi90/Population-Plot-CSV-Reader) in Replit.

## Usage  

This has not been deployed but code can be run directly on the Repl linked above.

You could replace the dummy dataset in the csv with any of the following:
1. [DataHub Population Data](https://datahub.io/core/population)
2. [WorldPop Hub Data](https://hub.worldpop.org/doi/10.5258/SOTON/WP00004)
3. [Kaggle Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dataanalyst001/world-population-by-country-2024)

## Development Ideas

1. Bar graph for each continent for each year to visualise growth in a different way.
2. Deploy these using Streamlit for better UX.
